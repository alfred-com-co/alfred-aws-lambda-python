## How to deploy üöÄ

This repository has GitHub Actions configuration files. When a new commit is pushed to 
the main branch, a new version of the Lambda function will automatically be deployed to 
the development environment.

> The event that fires the deployment flow is a `push`. Which means that `Pull Requests` 
> pointing to the main branch will also trigger the event.

You must configure these flows with the following command:

```bash
make lambda=<function-name> setup-deployment-flow
```

If you want to deploy a new version of the Lambda function in the production environment 
you can do it by going to the GitHub repository and within the actions tab you can 
trigger the deployment flow to production.

> For GitHub Actions flows to be able to run, you must `enable` this option in the `settings` 
> tab of your repository
